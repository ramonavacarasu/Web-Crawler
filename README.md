# Web-Crawler

### Hyperskill project

#### About
The Web is called so for a reason: all these pages are connected to many others through links, resembling a spider’s web. It’s easy to get lost and miss important links, so in this project you will write a program that might help. A Web Crawler collects and saves links from a given page, storing them in the memory for you to access later.
### Learning outcomes
You seem like a quite advanced user! Here you will gain even more skills: get to know Swing library and learn how to distribute tasks among the threads and control them.
